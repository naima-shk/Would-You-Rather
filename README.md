### Would You Rather Game

A ReactJS and Redux based game app where users can ask and answer questions to stay in the game.

This Game is built for my Udacity Nanodegree Program. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of ReactJS and Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
